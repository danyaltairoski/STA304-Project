# STA304-Project
STA304 (Surveys, Sampling and Observational Data) Group Project

A project from my Surveys, Sampling and Observational Data Course: Led a group of six in  "Measuring the Effectiveness of Online Learning Resources," which explores the impact and usage patterns among university students. Our study aligns with course objectives, emphasizing effective statistical communication, technical report writing, teamwork, self-learning, and crafting quality questionnaire questions. Focused on the students of the class, our analysis aims to reveal insights into the effectiveness of online learning resources, considering variables such as learning format and study engagement. Despite potential sample limitations, our project employs a generalized questionnaire to draw insights applicable to the broader student population, enhancing our statistical and communication skills in a real-world context.
